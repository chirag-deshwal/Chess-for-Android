# Chess for Android

Personal Coding Project

See "Releases" for good checkpoints to download and try the apk. 
My goal is to keep providing features with time. The code will become cleaner and things like AIs, online play and other features will eventually be added.

0.0.1 release:
   - Basic chess engine
   - Turn based (Player vs Player)
   - Most moving rules for the pieces apply (shadow rule for pawn, castling and moving if king is in check will be added)
   - Killing a king results in a win
